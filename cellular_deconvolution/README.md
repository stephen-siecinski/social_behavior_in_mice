# MusiC Cellular Deconvolution

This project aimed to improve our RNA-seq and DNA-methyl-seq analyses by estimating the relative proportions of neuronal and non-neuronal cells within our mouse amygdala and hippocampus samples. I accomplished this by using the [MuSiC](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-08023-x) algorithm paired with the ["Mouse Whole Cortex and Hippocampus 10x"](https://portal.brain-map.org/atlases-and-data/rnaseq/mouse-whole-cortex-and-hippocampus-10x) dataset from the Allen Brain Atlas.
